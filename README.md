## Interfacing AVR drivers using CMake

 ### I applied CMake in this project in a way that it will be generic, that means that anytime you finished or wrote a driver, all you need to do just add it, you don't need to write CMakeLists.txt for every driver you will make üòâ‚úåÔ∏è 
## Steps for adding new driver 
1. Open the Root CMakeLists.txt then create your driver
    ```
    set(drivers "MDIO;MPORT;ExampleDriver1;ExampleDriver2")
    create_driver_libraries(MCAL "${drivers}")
    ```
2. Open the Task CMakeLists.txt and add the drivers you will use in this task
    ```
    add_drivers(${PROJECT_NAME}  "MCAL" "MDIO;MPORT;ExampleDriver1;ExampleDriver2")
    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE MDIO MPORT ExampleDriver1 ExampleDriver2)
   ```
    
**Please take care of naming, Try to be all UPPERCASE as MDIO,ADC,UART,..... even the inc/src contents as MDIO.h,MDIO.c**
##
## How to build? 
```
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/COTS/avr-gcc-toolchain.cmake
```
```
cmake --build build 
```
##
## For flashing "Check Task CMakeLists.txt"
- For example if you want to flash the hex of Task1 in LAB2
```
cmake --build build --target flash_l2_task1
   ```
